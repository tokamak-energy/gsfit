        This method initialises the Rust `RogowskiCoils` class.

        :param pulseNo: Pulse number, used to read from the database
        :param settings: Dictionary containing the JSON settings read from the `settings` directory
        :param kwargs: Additional objects, such as FreeGNSKE object

        Initialising requires reading data from two locations:
        1. `sensor_weights_rogowski_coils.json`: Which contains "fitting parameters", e.g. if a probe should be used in the fitting
        2. Database reading (e.g. MDSplus, or FreeGNSKE object): Which contains the measurements and the Rogowski coil path

        Different machines will use different data stores for the probes geometry and measured signals.
        This Protocol allows different database readers to be selected.
        The output of this method must always be a `RogowskiCoils` object.

        At a minimum this method should look like this:
        ```python
